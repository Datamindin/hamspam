# hamspam
This repository contains a Python implementation of a ham spam classification model using natural language processing (NLP). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text messages, and can be used to predict whether a new text message is spam or ham.


To train the classification model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Organize your text messages into two categories, "ham" (legitimate) and "spam" (unsolicited or unwanted), and split the data into training and testing sets.

Preprocess the text data: Clean and preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and performing any necessary text transformations.

Train the model: Use the provided training script or Jupyter Notebook to train the model on your dataset. You can fine-tune the hyperparameters and architecture as needed.

Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model's performance on the testing set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the Spambase dataset, which contains a labeled dataset of text messages. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set.
